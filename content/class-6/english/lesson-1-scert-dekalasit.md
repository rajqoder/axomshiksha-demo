   |:---------------|:------------------|:------------------|
   | cold            | colder             | coldest            |

   | ............... | .................. | slowest            |

   **Ans:**

   | Positive Degree | Comparative Degree | Superlative Degree |
   |:---------------|:------------------|:------------------|
   | quiet           | quieter            | quietest           |
   | safe            | safer              | safest             |
   | slow            | slower             | slowest            |

   **(c) Look at the two pictures given below. Which picture do you like more and why? Discuss with your friend. You can use the adjectives given in the box in the comparative degree form.**

   ![Q.15(c)-diagram.webp](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOzrkQrekaMfg6n6RCuERtbppc-qYdF7Pc1q0E49aYepjgeSz_GChYgtIFMzHPJvq52IRRm5YB3osy3CWfG8EsACTYqcKwFqmUjxB0Th2KxKubBpHcwwyWr__HQlBqAZR9wgGzLe-TlJnCs7UK9xwmr=w661-h265-s-no-gm?authuser=0)
  
   Work with your friend and suggest some ways to protect nature.

   **Ans:** I like Picture 1 better because it is more green and looks cleaner than Picture 2. The trees look healthy, the river seems clean, and the area looks nice. In Picture 2, there is less green and it is a bit dirty, as trees have been cut and the land looks harmed.

   ### Ways to protect nature:

   1. We should plant more trees.
   2. We should not cut trees unnecessarily.
   3. We should keep our surroundings clean.
   4. We should save water and electricity.

   > When we talk about events or actions that will happen in the future, we use ‘will’. We also use ‘shall and other verbs to talk about actions that will occur at some time in the future.
