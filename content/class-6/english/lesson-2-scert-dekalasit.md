## Summary of the Story

King Midas was a wealthy ruler who desired more gold repeatedly. A divine spirit one day offered to grant him a wish. Midas requested that everything he touched be turned into gold.

Initially, he was overjoyed. He touched stones, flowers, and other things and they were turned into gold. However, he soon came to the realization that his wish was a curse. When he hugged his daughter, she too became a golden statue, and he could not eat or drink as his food and drink also turned to gold.

After he was overcome with sorrow, Midas begged the divine spirit to take back the wish. The spirit instructed him to wash in the river to free himself from the golden touch. Midas accomplished this, and the magic vanished. His daughter and everything else were restored to normal. Midas learned that love and happiness are much more valuable than gold and riches.

> The sentences given above refer to actions that happened before.

All the sentences talk about actions that happened before. When we talk about events or actions that took place at a definite time in the past, we use verbs in the Simple Past Tense. In the simple past tense of a verb, we say what we did yesterday, or last week, or even a long time ago. We use the second form of the verb by adding ‘-d’ or ‘-ed’ to the verb. Let’s see the first form / second form of the underlined verbs:

| Base form / First form | Past form / Second form |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| look                  | looked                  |
| treat                 | treated                 |
| want                  | wanted                  |
| grant                 | granted                 |
| rush                  | rushed                  |

**(b) Read the lesson to find out the past forms of the verbs given below. Write them down in the space provided:**

| Base Form | Past Form |
|-----------|-----------|
| live      |           |
| turn      |           |
| touch     |           |
| shock     |           |
| realise   |           |
    
**Ans:**

| Base Form | Past Form |
|-----------|-----------|
| live      | lived     |
| turn      | turned    |
| touch     | touched   |
| shock     | shocked   |
| realise   | realised  |

> There are few verbs that don't follow the usual pattern of adding '-d' or '-ed' at the end to form the past tense.  
> Examples  
> |           |           |
> |-----------|-----------|
> | go        | went      |
> | become    | became    |
> | get       | got       |
> | see       | saw       |

**(c) Read the paragraph and fill in the blanks with the Simple Past Tense form of the verbs.**

### 8. (a) Let's read an extract from a science fiction book.

**(b) Have you ever read science fiction before? Now, go to a library or search on the internet with the help of an elder to find such books. Write down the names of those books in the space given below:**

{{<flex marginY="1rem">}}
{{<flex direction="col">}}
{{<underscored-space no="2">}}
{{</flex>}}

{{<flex direction="col" marginY="1rem">}}
{{<underscored-space no="2">}}
{{</flex>}}
{{</flex>}}

**Ans:**

{{<content-box marginY="1rem" content="The Time Machine, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Around the World in Eighty Days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea">}}

**(c) Imagine that you live on the moon. Now, talk to your partner about your life there. Share with your friend how it is different from life on earth.**

**Ans:** If I were to live on the moon, my life would be drastically different. I would have to wear a space suit at all times since there is no air to breathe. I would probably feel as if I were floating all the time since the gravitational force is much weaker. The surface would be devoid of any trees, rivers, or animals like the ones we have here on earth.

**Find out a few more words from the text having two or more syllables and complete the list above.**
