## Summary of the Story

The story presents a conversation among three children—Nikita, her younger brother Orgo, and their cousin Meera. Nikita is busy painting a sunset scene when Orgo asks why the sky changes colour at different times. Nikita feels disturbed and scolds Orgo for asking questions.

Meera enters the room and listens to Orgo. She explains that asking questions is not wrong and that curiosity leads to great discoveries. To support her point, she tells the children about C. V. Raman, one of India’s greatest scientists. She narrates how a simple question—why the sea appears blue—led Raman to discover the scattering of light, later known as the Raman Effect.

Meera further explains Raman’s life, education, achievements, and contributions to science, including his Nobel Prize and Bharat Ratna. Nikita realises her mistake and apologises to Orgo. The story ends with the children learning the importance of curiosity, polite behaviour, and asking questions at the right time.
