|â€œOh yes! It is our age old custom.â€ | {{<underscored-space>}} |
|â€œWe will spend the night in our bhelaghar.â€ | {{<underscored-space>}} |

### 6. Let's learn some grammar:

#### (a) Read the following two sentences.

(i) We will spend the night in our bhelaghar.  
(ii) Weâ€™ll carry as much vegetables as possible.

**Note the following**  
> - We can write *we will* as *weâ€™ll*.  
> - *Weâ€™ll* is the shorter form of *we will*.


**Now rewrite the following sentences using the short form of *will*.**

1. Mahen said, â€œWe will make a bhelaghar.â€  
   **Ans:** Mahen said, â€œWeâ€™ll make a bhelaghar.â€

2. They will spend the night in the bhelaghar.  
   **Ans:** Theyâ€™ll spend the night in the bhelaghar.

3. Sajan thought, â€œWhen everyone is asleep, I will pick vegetables.â€

4. Mahen said, â€œWe will help each other to cook the food.â€  
   **Ans:** Mahen said, â€œWeâ€™ll help each other to cook the food.â€

5. They will have an uruka adventure.  
   **Ans:** Theyâ€™ll have an uruka adventure.

#### (b) Now read the following sentences:

(i) We'll carry as much as possible in our hands.  
(ii) I shall wait to see who comes to steal my vegetables.

**Note the following:**

> We use words like **will** and **shall** to talk about something that is going to happen in the future.

#### (c) Note the difference in meaning between the first two sentences and the third:

(i) We **will spend** the night in the bhelaghar.  
(ii) We shall go and pick vegetables.  
(iii) We **spent** the night in the bhelaghar.

> The first two sentences express future time and the third sentence expresses past time.

#### (d) Note the forms of negative sentences:

(i) We **will not** spend the night in the bhelaghar.  
(ii) We **did not** spend the night in the bhelaghar.

> We use **will not** or **won't** and **did not** or **didn't** to express a negative meaning.

**Now check your grammar. Rewrite these sentences by changing the underlined verbs to express future time.**

(i) Mahen *called* his friends to his house.  
(ii) Mahen *jumped* up in joy.  
(iii) They *decided* to celebrate Uruka together.  
(iv) They *planned* to hold the feast in Mahen's house.  
(v) We *went* to pick vegetables from Shantiram's garden.

### 8. (a) Read the paragraphs given below carefully. They describe what the friends did on uruka night. All the words highlighted in italics bold refer to actions that took place in the past.

Mahen and his friends ***decided*** to hold a feast together. They ***planned*** to hold the feast at Mahenâ€™s compound. Mahen and Sanju ***said*** that they would do the shopping for the feast at the nearby market. Mahenâ€™s friends Nantu and Rinku ***suggested*** that they should cook for the feast themselves.

Rumon ***offered*** to cook the vegetables and the fish. Sanju and Nantu ***said*** that they would cook the rice, the lentils and the chicken. The five friends ***proposed*** that they would spend the entire night at Mahenâ€™s compound.

As planned earlier, the five boys ***built*** a big shed using straw and bamboo. Rumonâ€™s uncle ***helped*** them with the task. The boys joyfully ***cooked*** for the feast with a little supervision and help from Mahenâ€™s mother. When the feast ***was*** over, Mahen ***commanded*** his friends to follow him on their nocturnal adventure. They ***made*** straight for Shantiramâ€™s house at the end of the lane. The five friends ***tiptoed*** into his garden after crossing the nongola. Suddenly, they ***saw*** a black heap of garbage in the middle of the rows of vegetables. They ***thought*** it was inert and harmless. But when the boys ***stretched*** their hands to pick the vegetables, the heap suddenly ***moved***! Terrified, they ***fled*** from the scene. What a narrow escape they ***had***!

**Now sit in groups. Then, using verbs in similar forms, tell the group how you celebrated one of your festivals this year. Did you have an adventure like Mahen or was it a rather ordinary experience for you?**
