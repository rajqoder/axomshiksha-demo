### 6. Let's learn some grammar:

#### (a) Read the following two sentences.

(i) We will spend the night in our bhelaghar.  
(ii) We’ll carry as much vegetables as possible.

**Note the following**  
> - We can write *we will* as *we’ll*.  
> - *We’ll* is the shorter form of *we will*.


**Now rewrite the following sentences using the short form of *will*.**

1. Mahen said, “We will make a bhelaghar.”  
   **Ans:** Mahen said, “We’ll make a bhelaghar.”

2. They will spend the night in the bhelaghar.  
   **Ans:** They’ll spend the night in the bhelaghar.

3. Sajan thought, “When everyone is asleep, I will pick vegetables.”

   **Ans:** Mahen said, “We’ll help each other to cook the food.”

5. They will have an uruka adventure.  
   **Ans:** They’ll have an uruka adventure.

#### (b) Now read the following sentences:

(i) We'll carry as much as possible in our hands.  
(ii) I shall wait to see who comes to steal my vegetables.

**Note the following:**

> We use words like **will** and **shall** to talk about something that is going to happen in the future.

#### (c) Note the difference in meaning between the first two sentences and the third:

(i) We **will spend** the night in the bhelaghar.  
(ii) We shall go and pick vegetables.  
(iii) We **spent** the night in the bhelaghar.

> The first two sentences express future time and the third sentence expresses past time.

#### (d) Note the forms of negative sentences:

(i) We **will not** spend the night in the bhelaghar.  
(ii) We **did not** spend the night in the bhelaghar.

> We use **will not** or **won't** and **did not** or **didn't** to express a negative meaning.

**Now check your grammar. Rewrite these sentences by changing the underlined verbs to express future time.**

(i) Mahen *called* his friends to his house.  
(ii) Mahen *jumped* up in joy.  
(iii) They *decided* to celebrate Uruka together.  
(iv) They *planned* to hold the feast in Mahen's house.  
(v) We *went* to pick vegetables from Shantiram's garden.

Mahen and Sanju ***said*** that they would do the shopping for the feast at the nearby market. Mahen’s friends Nantu and Rinku ***suggested*** that they should cook for the feast themselves.

Rumon ***offered*** to cook the vegetables and the fish. Sanju and Nantu ***said*** that they would cook the rice, the lentils and the chicken. The five friends ***proposed*** that they would spend the entire night at Mahen’s compound.

As planned earlier, the five boys ***built*** a big shed using straw and bamboo. Rumon’s uncle ***helped*** them with the task. The boys joyfully ***cooked*** for the feast with a little supervision and help from Mahen’s mother. When the feast ***was*** over, Mahen ***commanded*** his friends to follow him on their nocturnal adventure. They ***made*** straight for Shantiram’s house at the end of the lane. The five friends ***tiptoed*** into his garden after crossing the nongola. Suddenly, they ***saw*** a black heap of garbage in the middle of the rows of vegetables. They ***thought*** it was inert and harmless. But when the boys ***stretched*** their hands to pick the vegetables, the heap suddenly ***moved***! Terrified, they ***fled*** from the scene. What a narrow escape they ***had***!
